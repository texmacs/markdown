# TeXmacs markdown plugin

This plugin is a (for now one-way) converter to markdown format for 
[TeXmacs](http://www.texmacs.org/). It supports most of the standard Markdown 
syntax, plus much of TeXmacs' non-dynamic markup. In particular, labels and 
references, numbered environments and figures should work out of the box. The 
major exception are tables, but as a workaround the plugin offers the 
possibility of exporting them as html into the markdown file.

The plugin has been developed for its use in two specific websites, 
[Paperwhy](https://paperwhy.8027.org/) and appliedAI's 
[TransferLab](https://transferlab.appliedai.de/), and can use multiple 
extensions specific to the static website generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). 
There might still be some code very specific to those sites, YMMV.

## Setup

Clone this repository into your `~/.TeXmacs/plugins` directory as `markdown`. 
For Linux / OSX this is:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/texmacs/markdown.git ~/.TeXmacs/plugins/markdown
```

For Windows, the path (usually?) is

```shell
\Users\YourUser\AppData\Roaming\TeXmacs\plugins
```

## Preferences

You can activate the plugin menu with `Tools -> Markdown plugin`. In it you 
will find a convenient `Export…` action, as well as all configurable 
preferences:

* `Flavour`: As of version 0.5.3 this is either `Hugo` or `vanilla`.
* `Paragraph width`: number of columns at which to wrap text in the generated 
  output. Set it to an empty value to deactivate wrapping.
* `Numbered sections?` Whether to prepend section numbers to numbered section 
  titles.
* `Export on save?` Whether to automatically export the 
  document **overwriting** the last exported markdown file, every time the 
  TeXmacs buffer is saved. The path to the exported file is stored in the 
  document's *auxiliary data* either as a relative or an absolute path with 
  respect to the document. Relative can be useful e.g. if the document is 
  shared.

# Features

## Additional TeXmacs macros

Use the style package `markdown.ts` with `Document -> Style -> Add 
package -> Markdown -> markdown` to enable:

* Support for alternate image formats between TeXmacs and markdown via 
  `<md-alt-image|tm-image|md-image>`. This is useful e.g. to provide 
  SVG and EPS/PDF versions of images for print and web respectively.
* Macros for labels in equation arrays. Using positioning tricks with 
  `<htab>` results in LaTeX code that MathJax does not support, namely 
  `\hfill`. For this reason, we provide two macros 
  `<eqnarray-lab|lab>` and `<eqnarray-lab\*|lab>` which allow 
  positioning of equation labels to the right in equation arrays. The first one 
  also adds a `<label|eq:lab>` to be used in the document.

## Extensions to vanilla markdown

Besides standard Markdown, this plugin supports the following:

* Footnotes (and marginal notes, exported as footnotes for vanilla markdown).
* Links to equations and equation arrays. Labels are exported as HTML 
  `<span>` with identifiers sanitized and custom CSS. See 
  `extensions/tmmarkdown.css`.
* Most standard environments, both numbered and unnumbered. Localized and with 
  support for references and `<smart-ref>`.
* Numbered and unnumbered sections.
* Nested lists and styles applied to environments.

## Hugo support

In addition to the above, almost everything that Hugo supports can be converted 
from TeXmacs, including setting frontmatter values and extensions like 
footnotes and ~~striked through text~~.

Use the style package `hugo.ts` with `Document -> Style -> Add 
package -> Markdown -> hugo` to enable:

* All of the markdown extensions above
* Setting of values for the frontmatter. With `<hugo-front>` one can 
  input any number of `key|value` pairs as arguments, one argument each. That 
  is: insert the tag `<hugo-front>`, then use structured insert right 
  to add two arguments and use the first for the key and the second for the 
  value. Repeat as needed. It is possible to use strings, booleans (`true`, 
  `false`) or dates (insert with `<date>`). Additionally, the macro 
  `<pdf-name>` inserts the name of the file with `.pdf` appended. To 
  enter a list, input `<tuple>` as the value and use structured insert 
  right to add items. To input a dictionary, use `<dict>` and again 
  use structured insert to create tuples of `key|value`.

### Supported shortcodes

All custom shortcodes are in `extensions/hugo/`.

* Figures are converted to `{{< figure  >}}`.
* For arbitrary shortcodes, use `<hugo-short>`, e.g. 
  `<hugo-short|toc>` for `{{< toc >}}`.
* Citations using `<cite>` and `<cite-detail>` (of any arity) 
  are automatically detected and converted to `{{< cite ref >}}`, and 
  all of them are gathered in the frontmatter as well, for indization by Hugo's 
  taxonomy system. The rendering of bibliography is done by `{{< 
  references >}}`.
* Marginal notes and figures are converted to `{{< sidenote  >}}` and 
  `{{< sidefigure  >}}`.

# Known issues

For an up-to date list, see the [issue tracker in 
GitHub](https://github.com/texmacs/markdown/issues/).

* The converter can break with malformed or unexpected input, like markup 
  inside tags whose values should be strings (although many cases are 
  “handled”).
* Error reporting is rather lacking. Run TeXmacs in a console to see stack 
  traces and such in case you are running into problems.
* EPS and PDF images are not supported by browsers. As a workaround allowing to 
  have both, use `<md-alt-image>` in package `markdown.ts` as 
  explained above. The first argument is for TeXmacs and the second one for the 
  markdown export.
* The converter supports only one style. For instance all environments have 
  emphasized bodies and bold names, `<section>` is exported as `h1`, 
  etc.
