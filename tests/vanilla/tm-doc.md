# A tm-doc title

This is a test of exports of documents with the tm-doc style package.

This is a menu with three items: `Markdown -> Flavour -> Hugo`

This is a submenu with the same amount of items (should display only two): 
`Flavour -> Hugo`

This is a subsubmenu (3 items, should display one): `Hugo`

This is a `tag`.

This is an explained macro `<name|argument1|argument2>`.

These are two nested explained macros 
`<name|argument1|<name|argument1|argument2>>`.
